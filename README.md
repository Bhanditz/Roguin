# Roguin
One stop shop for Social Network integrations

### What is Roguin
Social Network SDKs can be a pain to setup and maintain. This goes double if you want to add more than one SDK into a 
single project. With Roguin, the whole process is simplified and Google, Facebook and Twitter are unified and handled
with the same code.

#### You can add Sing In With for all three networks with the same exact code!

### Preparation
Roguin helps with code but you still need valid Applications as per Social Network regulations and guidelines.
So, you would still need to:
- **Configure a Project** for Google through https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating#configure_a_console_name_project
- **Create A New App** for Facebook through https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android
- **Create a New Twitter App** from https://apps.twitter.com
